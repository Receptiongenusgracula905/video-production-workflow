# Video Production Skill

A portable Claude Code skill for creating branded video content with **Remotion** (React-based video framework), **sound design**, and **voiceover**. Captures proven patterns from production — scene templates, animation language, component architecture, and end-to-end workflow.

## Installation

### Claude Code (Global)

Copy the skill into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJenglert1/video-production.git ~/.claude/skills/video-production
```

Claude Code automatically loads skills from `~/.claude/skills/` when referenced.

### Per-Project

Clone into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
cd your-project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/JJenglert1/video-production.git .claude/skills/video-production
```

### For Other Tools (Codex, etc.)

Clone wherever your tool reads skill/instruction files from:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJenglert1/video-production.git ~/skills/video-production
```

## Usage

Reference the skill by name in your Claude Code prompts:

```
Using the video-production skill, set up a new Remotion project for Acme Corp
```

```
Use the video-production skill to create scenes for this transcript: [paste transcript]
```

```
Following the video-production workflow, add sound design to this video
```

You can also reference specific rule files:

```
Follow the video-production brand-system rules to define colors for my brand
```

```
Use the video-production animation patterns for these scene transitions
```

## Quick Start: New Video Project

1. **Set up the repo** → `rules/project-setup.md`
   - Scaffold Remotion project, configure brand.ts, fonts.ts, asset pipeline

2. **Define your brand** → `rules/brand-system.md`
   - Colors, gradients, typography, surfaces — swap these and everything inherits

3. **Build components** → `rules/components.md`
   - BrandBackground, GradientText, PillBadge, AnimatedText, BrandLogo

4. **Create templates** → `rules/templates.md`
   - Pick from 9 proven templates: titles, callouts, quotes, prompts, split-screen

5. **Compose scenes** → `rules/scene-patterns.md`
   - Pro tips, pain points, competitor cards, side-by-side comparisons, notifications

6. **Animate** → `rules/animation.md`
   - Spring physics, staggered entrances, highlight walking, idle float

7. **Add sound** → `rules/sound-design.md`
   - SFX on transitions, music beds, volume envelopes via FFmpeg

8. **Generate voiceover** → `rules/voiceover.md`
   - Eleven Labs integration, script timing, Remotion audio embedding

9. **Render & deliver** → `rules/rendering.md`
   - Single scene, batch, chunk rendering for long scenes

## Adapting for a New Brand

The entire system is brand-agnostic. To adapt for a new brand:

1. Replace colors in `brand.ts` with the new palette
2. Replace font files in `public/fonts/` and update `fonts.ts`
3. Replace logo assets in `public/brand/`
4. Update gradient definitions

**No template or component code needs to change** — everything references the brand constants.

## What This Skill Produces

- **Title cards** — branded motion graphics overlays for video editing
- **Scene transitions** — animated transitions between video sections
- **Prompt displays** — code/text displays with walking highlights synced to voiceover
- **Sound design** — background music with volume envelopes + SFX at key moments
- **Animated backgrounds** — gradient breathing backgrounds for B-roll
- **Complete video packages** — all of the above, assembled into a production pipeline
